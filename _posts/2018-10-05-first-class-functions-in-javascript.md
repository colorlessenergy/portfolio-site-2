# first class functions

first class functions are first class citizens which mean they are treated like any other variable.

## Functions are treated the same way as objects

can be assigned to variables, array values object values
can be passed as arguments to other functions
can be returned from functions

## allows for the creation of higher-order functions

either takes one or more function as arguments or returns a function

some examples of higher order functions

map(), filter(), reduce()


happy coding :)
