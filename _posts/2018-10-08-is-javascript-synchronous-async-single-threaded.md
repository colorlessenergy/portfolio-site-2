# is javascript synchronous, async, or single threaded

it's all of them...

Javascript is a single-threaded, synchronous language. A function that takes a long time to run it will cause the page to become unresponsive

Javascript does have functions that act asynchronously

It is single threaded which means it doesn't have any other processes going on at a single time. Synchronous. means can't move on until something is done

<p class="highlight__file-desc">
 JavaScript
</p>

```javascript
function hang(seconds) {
 // gets the current time in ms
 let now = new Date().getTime();

 while(
   new Date().getTime() <
   now + (seconds * 1000)
   )
 {/* do nothing */ }
}
```

because javascript is single threaded and synchronous the while loop in the hang function will keep running which makes the page unresponsive because it is taking up the only thread JavaScript has.

this is terrible because if you have a lot of functions that take more then a second to run the page will be really slow and bad.

This problem is the reason that javascript has asynchronous functions.

## asynchronous javascript

Some terms you may have heard of.

* execution stack
* browser apis
* function queue
* event loop

These are very powerful to getting things done without blocking the user.

### execution stack

whatever javascript is running. runs synchronously. Determines what order things are ran. if you have a bunch of functions on the stack it pops them off then runs it.

### browser apis

A bunch of functions that is provided by the browser. Also known as the window object.

![window object]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/window-object.png)

If we call one of the browser api it is ran separately.

Some browser apis are <span class="highlight__code">setTimeout()</span>, <span class="highlight__code">setInterval()</span>.

### function queue

Queues up functions that are ready to be runned.

### event loop

When the execution stack is cleared it says I need to do something else. The event loop tells the execution stack that there is a function waiting on the function queue then puts one on the stack.

## how it works all together

This javascript code is ran.

```javascript
setTimeout(function () {
 console.log('runned after 1 second')
}, 1000)
```

It just console log something after 1 second of waiting. it will get executed then sent to the browser api to get and run <span class="highlight__code">setTimeout()</span> then it will wait for the time that was given in this case it is 1 second then the function will get to sent to the function queue then the event loop will send it back to the execution stack to be ranned.


```javascript
function printOne() {
 console.log('1');
}

function printTwo() {
 console.log('2');
}

function printThree() {
 console.log('3');
}

setTimeout(printOne, 1000);
setTimeout(printTwo, 0);
printThree();

// 3 2 1
```

It prints 3 2 1 because it has asynchronous functions. It run the <span class="highlight__code">setTimeout()</span> then it is sent to the browser api and waits 1000 seconds. Then it runs the second <span class="highlight__code">setTimeout()</span> which it is sent to the browser api and waits 0 seconds. Then <span class="highlight__code">printThree()</span> which just runs and prints 3 first. after the 0 seconds passes by the <span class="highlight__code">setTimeout()</span> for <span class="highlight__code">printTwo()</span> gets sent to the function queue then it waits for the execution stack to be empty then event loop sends the first function in the queue to the execution stack to be runned and prints two after three. after <span class="highlight__code">printOne()</span> <span class="highlight__code">setTimeout()</span> waits 1 second it gets sent to the function queue then the event loop waits for the execution stack to be empty then sends the <span class="highlight__code">printOne()</span> function to the execution stack and prints 1 after 2.




## how to control the flow of asynchronous calls

callbacks.

controls flow with asynchronous calls

executes a function once asynchronous call returns a value.

```javascript
// simulate fetching data from db
function getUserFromDataBase(callback) {
 setTimeout(function () {
   callback(
     {firstName: 'Brian', lastName: 'Munoz'})
 }, 1000);
}

// query database for user and greet
// the user
function greetUser() {
 // how we do it synchronous
 // this might never return a value..
 let user = getUserSync();
 console.log('hi, ' + user.firstName);

 // async

 getUserFromDataBase(function (userObject) {
   console.log('hi, ' + userObject.firstName)
 });
}

greetUser();

```

## promises

alleviates 'callback hell'
allows you to write code that assumes a value is returned within a success function
only needs a single error handlers
